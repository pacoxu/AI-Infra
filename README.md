# AI-Infra Landscape & Learning Path üöÄ

Welcome to the **AI-Infra** repository! This project provides a curated landscape and structured learning path for engineers building and operating modern **AI infrastructure**, especially in the Kubernetes and cloud-native ecosystem.

## üåê Overview

This landscape visualizes key components across the AI Infrastructure stack, mapped by:

- **Horizontal Axis (X):**
  - Left: Prototype / Early-stage projects
  - Right: Kernel & Runtime maturity

- **Vertical Axis (Y):**
  - Bottom: Infrastructure Layer (Kernel/Runtime)
  - Top: Application Layer (AI/Inference)

The goal is to demystify the evolving AI Infra stack and guide engineers on where to focus their learning.

## üìä AI-Infra Landscape (2025)

**Legend:**

> - Dashed outlines = Early stage or under exploration
> - Labels on right = Functional categories
