from kubeflow.training import constants

# Initialize the training client
client = TrainingClient()

# Define the training job
client.create_job(
    name="pytorch-distributed-training",
    namespace="kubeflow",
    base_image="pytorch/pytorch:2.0.0-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime",
    num_workers=4,
    num_gpus_per_worker=1,
    command=[
        "python",
        "train.py",
        "--epochs", "100",
        "--batch-size", "32"
    ]
)

# Monitor the training job
client.wait_for_job_completion("pytorch-distributed-training")

# Get training logs
logs = client.get_job_logs("pytorch-distributed-training")
print(logs)
```

```python
from kubeflow.training import TrainingClient

client = TrainingClient()

# Fine-tune LLaMA-2 with LoRA
client.create_job(
    name="llama2-lora-finetuning",

    num_workers=2,
    num_gpus_per_worker=4,
    command=[
        "python",
        "finetune_llama.py",
        "--model_name", "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf",

```

## Architecture and Workflow

### Training Job Lifecycle

1. **Job Creation**: User submits training job via Python API or YAML
2. **Scheduling**: Training Operator creates pods with gang scheduling
3. **Initialization**: Pods initialize distributed training environment
4. **Training**: Distributed training executes across all workers
5. **Checkpointing**: Periodic checkpoint saves to persistent storage
6. **Completion**: Job completes and resources are cleaned up
7. **Monitoring**: Metrics and logs are collected for observability

### Integration with Kubernetes Resources

- **Pods**: Each training replica runs in a separate pod
- **Services**: Communication between master and worker pods
- **ConfigMaps**: Training configuration and hyperparameters
- **PersistentVolumeClaims**: Checkpoint and dataset storage
- **Secrets**: API keys and credentials

## Integration with ArgoCD

Kubeflow training jobs can be deployed and managed using ArgoCD for GitOps
workflows. See [ArgoCD for AI Workloads](./argocd.md) for more details.

## Best Practices

### Job Configuration

- Use resource requests and limits to ensure proper scheduling
- Configure gang scheduling for distributed jobs
- Set appropriate restart policies (OnFailure, Never)
- Use init containers for data preparation

### Storage Management

- Use PersistentVolumes for checkpoints and datasets
- Consider using CSI drivers for high-performance storage (Fluid, JuiceFS)
- Implement checkpoint cleanup policies
- Cache datasets locally when possible

### Monitoring and Debugging

- Enable Prometheus metrics for job monitoring
- Use Kubeflow UI for job status and logs
- Configure alerts for job failures
- Maintain audit logs for compliance

### Security

- Use RBAC for access control
- Store sensitive data in Kubernetes Secrets
- Enable network policies for pod isolation
- Use service accounts with minimal permissions
