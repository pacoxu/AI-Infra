## üéØ Week 1: AI-Infra Concept Updates & Fundamentals

### üìö Core Concept Refresh

**Objective:** Update understanding of "What is AI Infrastructure" in 2025

#### Modern AI-Infra Definition (2025)
AI Infrastructure has evolved beyond traditional ML pipelines to encompass:

- **Real-time Inference**: Ultra-low latency requirements for interactive AI

#### Key Architectural Shifts

**From Monolithic to Disaggregated:**
- Prefill/Decode separation in LLM serving
- Distributed KV cache management
- Model-specific resource allocation

**From Static to Dynamic:**
- AI-aware autoscaling (TTFT, TPOT metrics)
- Dynamic LoRA switching
- Context-aware request routing

### üìñ Learning Tasks
