   - Affects perceived responsiveness
   - Target: < 50ms per token for conversational AI

3. **ITL (Inter-Token Latency)**
   - Consistency of token generation timing
   - Important for streaming applications
   - Target: Low variance in generation times

4. **Throughput (Tokens/Second)**
   - Overall system capacity
   - Important for batch processing
   - Measured at system and per-model level

### Infrastructure Metrics

1. **GPU Utilization**
   - Actual compute utilization vs. allocation
   - Memory bandwidth utilization
   - Multi-instance GPU (MIG) efficiency

2. **Cache Hit Rates**
   - Prefix cache effectiveness
   - KV cache efficiency
   - Model cache utilization

3. **Network Performance**
   - RDMA/InfiniBand utilization
   - Inter-node communication latency
   - Bandwidth utilization for model loading
