## What is PD Disaggregation

In LLM inference, the process can be divided into two distinct phases:

- **Prefill**: processes the entire input prompt in parallel, builds KV cache.
- **Decode**: generates output tokens one by one using the KV cache.

In a monolithic setup, both prefill and decode run on the same GPU, which causes resource contention (e.g., prefill latency impacting decode throughput). **PD Disaggregation** addresses this by disaggregating prefill and decode phases into separate GPU workers or nodes.

**Benefits:**

- Improved latency (TTFT and TPOT)
- Higher throughput per GPU
- Independent scaling and tuning of each phase
- Flexibility for scheduling and load balancing

## Workload Solutions

This section covers specific workload orchestration solutions that enable
efficient PD disaggregation architectures in Kubernetes environments.

### LWS (LeaderWorkSet)

[`LWS (LeaderWorkSet)`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws) is a
Kubernetes SIG project that provides a workload API for managing groups of
Pods with leader-follower relationships. For P/D disaggregation, LWS can be
used with StatefulSet and Pod resources to orchestrate disaggregated
inference workloads.

**Key Features for P/D Disaggregation:**

- **Dual LWS Architecture**: Use two separate LWS instances - one for prefill
  workers and another for decode workers
- **Leader-Follower Coordination**: Enable coordination between prefill and
  decode phases through leader selection
- **StatefulSet Integration**: Work alongside StatefulSets for persistent
  storage and networking requirements
- **Pod Group Management**: Manage groups of Pods as cohesive units for
  scaling and lifecycle management

**Architecture Pattern:**

```text
Prefill LWS + StatefulSet + Pods  →  KV Cache Transfer  →  Decode LWS + StatefulSet + Pods
```

This approach enables independent scaling and resource management for each
phase while maintaining coordination through the LWS leader-follower pattern.

### SGLang RBG

[`SGLang RBG`](https://github.com/sgl-project/rbg) is a resource-aware batch
scheduler designed for efficient LLM inference workload management. The
project learned from and reused design patterns from the LWS project.

**Key Features:**

- **LWS-Inspired Design**: Incorporates proven patterns from the LWS project
  for workload orchestration
- **Resource-Aware Scheduling**: Optimizes batch scheduling based on
  available GPU resources and workload characteristics
- **P/D Disaggregation Support**: Enables efficient scheduling of disaggregated
  prefill and decode workloads
- **Batch Optimization**: Provides intelligent batching strategies for
  improved throughput

**Integration with P/D Disaggregation:**

SGLang RBG enhances P/D disaggregation by providing:

- Intelligent scheduling of prefill and decode batches
- Resource optimization across disaggregated components
- Coordination between prefill and decode phases

### AIBrix StormService

[`AIBrix StormService`](https://github.com/vllm-project/aibrix/blob/fd8ddd8062602313c5f7b3b7ecbda20e845da647/docs/source/designs/aibrix-stormservice.rst)
is a specialized component designed to manage and orchestrate the lifecycle
of inference containers in Prefill/Decode disaggregated architectures.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **P/D Lifecycle Management**: Specialized orchestration for disaggregated
  prefill and decode container lifecycles
- **Multi-Mode Support**: Manages various deployment modes including:
  - Prefill/Decode disaggregation
  - Tensor Parallelism (TP)
  - Pipeline Parallelism (PP)
  - Single GPU model deployments
- **Container Orchestration**: Provides fine-grained control over inference
  container deployment and scaling
- **Resource Coordination**: Ensures proper resource allocation and
  coordination between disaggregated components

**StormService Architecture:**

StormService acts as a specialized controller that:

1. Manages the deployment of prefill and decode containers
2. Coordinates resource allocation across disaggregated components
3. Handles lifecycle events (scaling, updates, failures)
4. Optimizes resource utilization across different parallelism modes

This enables enterprise-grade P/D disaggregation with robust lifecycle
management and multi-tenancy support.
