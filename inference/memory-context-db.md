## Overview

Memory and context management are critical components for AI agents and LLM
applications. As agents become more sophisticated, they require efficient
mechanisms to store, retrieve, and manage both short-term conversational
context and long-term knowledge across sessions.

**Key Challenges:**

- Managing growing context windows and KV cache
- Balancing short-term chat history with long-term knowledge
- Ensuring consistency across thousands of concurrent agents
- Garbage collection for inactive agent sessions
- API standardization for memory operations

---

## Short-Term vs Long-Term Memory

### Short-Term Memory (Chat Context)

Short-term memory refers to the immediate conversational context within an
active session, typically stored in KV cache or working memory.

**Characteristics:**

- **Duration**: Active session only (seconds to hours)
- **Storage**: GPU VRAM, host RAM, or fast cache
- **Size**: Limited by context window (typically 4K-128K tokens)
- **Access Pattern**: Sequential, high-frequency reads/writes
- **Persistence**: Usually volatile, cleared after session ends

**Use Cases:**

- Multi-turn conversations
- In-session context tracking
- Immediate response generation
- Prompt caching for repeated prefixes

**Technologies:**

- KV Cache (see [Caching in LLM Inference](./caching.md))
- In-memory buffers
- Session-specific storage

### Long-Term Memory (Knowledge Base)

Long-term memory refers to persistent knowledge that survives across sessions,
enabling agents to recall past interactions and learned information.

**Characteristics:**

- **Duration**: Persistent across sessions (days to years)
- **Storage**: Databases, vector stores, object storage
- **Size**: Potentially unlimited (scaled by database capacity)
- **Access Pattern**: Random access, retrieval-based queries
- **Persistence**: Durable storage with backup and recovery

**Use Cases:**

- User preference tracking
- Historical conversation retrieval
- Domain-specific knowledge bases
- Personalization across sessions
- Multi-agent collaboration state

**Technologies:**

- Vector databases (Milvus, Chroma, Pinecone)
- Traditional databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Object stores (S3, GCS, MinIO)
- Graph databases for relationship tracking

## Agent Memory Architecture

Modern AI agents typically employ a hierarchical memory architecture that
combines multiple storage layers for optimal performance.

### Memory Hierarchy

                                  └──────────┘
```

### API Shapes for Agent Memory

According to CNCF TOC discussions, standardized API shapes are needed for:

- **State persistence**: Save and restore agent state
- **Memory retrieval**: Query historical interactions
- **Context injection**: Add external knowledge to prompts
- **Memory updates**: Incrementally update agent knowledge
- **Garbage collection**: Clean up inactive or expired memory

**Example API Operations:**

```text
GET    /agent/{id}/memory/recent       # Get recent conversation
POST   /agent/{id}/memory/store        # Store new memory
GET    /agent/{id}/memory/search       # Semantic search in memory
DELETE /agent/{id}/memory/prune        # Garbage collect old entries
GET    /agent/{id}/state               # Get full agent state
POST   /agent/{id}/state/restore       # Restore agent state
```

## Memory Backends

Different backend systems serve different memory management needs.

**Best For**: Fast access to recent state and session data

**Characteristics:**

- Sub-millisecond latency
- Ephemeral or persistent storage modes
- Pub/sub for real-time updates
- TTL-based automatic expiration

**Use Cases:**

- Active session state
- Recent conversation history
- Distributed cache for agent state
- Rate limiting and request tracking

### Vector Databases

**Best For**: Semantic search and similarity-based retrieval

**Characteristics:**

- Embedding-based search
- Similarity scoring
- Metadata filtering
- Horizontal scalability

**Use Cases:**

## Consistency and Garbage Collection

Managing state consistency and memory cleanup across thousands of concurrent
agents presents unique challenges.

### Consistency Challenges

**Problem Areas:**

- **Multi-agent coordination**: Agents reading/writing shared state
- **Distributed deployments**: State spread across multiple nodes
- **Session handoff**: Transferring agent state between replicas
- **Concurrent updates**: Multiple requests modifying same agent state

**Solutions:**

- **Optimistic locking**: Version-based conflict detection
- **Event sourcing**: Append-only state changes
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for scalability
- **Distributed transactions**: Two-phase commit for critical operations

### Garbage Collection Strategies

Automatic cleanup of inactive or expired agent memory is essential for system
health.

**TTL-Based Expiration:**

- Set time-to-live on memory entries
- Automatic deletion after expiration
- Redis native support for TTL
- Suitable for session-based state

**Reference Counting:**

- Track active references to agent state
- Delete when reference count reaches zero
- Useful for shared memory across agents

**LRU/LFU Eviction:**

- Least Recently Used or Least Frequently Used
- Keep hot data in cache, evict cold data
- Memory-bounded caches

**Manual Cleanup:**

- Explicit agent session termination
- User-initiated data deletion
- Compliance-driven data retention policies

**Background Jobs:**

- Periodic scan for inactive sessions
- Batch deletion of old entries
- Off-peak execution to minimize impact
