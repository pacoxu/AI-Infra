## Overview

Model switching is a critical operation in modern LLM inference systems that
enables:

- **Multi-model serving** on limited GPU resources
- **Dynamic resource allocation** based on request patterns
- **Cost optimization** through efficient GPU utilization
- **Reduced latency** for multi-tenant inference platforms

Traditional model switching requires:

- Restarting Python processes
- Re-initializing CUDA contexts
- Re-compiling GPU kernels
- Re-capturing CUDA graphs

This results in switching overhead of 30-100 seconds per model change, making
frequent model switching impractical.

**Modern approaches** optimize model switching through:

1. **Token-level scheduling** - Make switching decisions after each token
2. **Sleep mode** - Preserve process state while freeing GPU memory
3. **Component reuse** - Share compiled kernels and CUDA graphs
4. **KV cache synchronization** - Efficiently transfer cached data

These techniques reduce model switching overhead by **up to 97%**, enabling
real-time multi-model serving with sub-second switching latency.

## Alibaba Aegaeon: Token-Level Scheduling

[Aegaeon](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uJyk0HALKFZysTAgghjgpw) is Alibaba's
distributed LLM serving system that pioneers **token-level scheduling**,
enabling dynamic model switching decisions after each generated token.

### Key Innovation: Token-Level Scheduling

Traditional inference systems make model selection decisions at the request
level. Aegaeon introduces **token-level granularity**, allowing the system
to:

- Evaluate model switching needs after each token generation
- Switch models mid-inference based on latency requirements
- Serve multiple models concurrently while meeting SLOs
- Optimize resource allocation in real-time

### Architecture and Components

Aegaeon is implemented as a distributed LLM serving system with:

- **5,700 lines** of Python and CUDA/C++ code
- **Control plane**: Built on asyncio for concurrent orchestration
- **Data plane**: Uses Ray for distributed data management
- **Execution backend**: Leverages vLLM for broad architecture support

![Aegaeon Implementation Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3aea800-f62d-465a-b6f7-92753500f445)

*Figure 1: Aegaeon Implementation - Control plane uses asyncio for
concurrency, data plane uses Ray for distribution, and vLLM provides the
model execution backend with support for modern optimizations like
FlashAttention and PagedAttention.*

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Accurate Execution Time Prediction

Aegaeon uses machine learning models to predict:

- Token generation latency for each model
- Resource requirements per request
- Optimal switching points during inference

#### 2. Token-Level Scheduling Algorithm

The scheduler determines model switching based on:

- **Current latency budget** remaining for the request
- **Predicted execution time** for candidate models
- **Resource availability** across the cluster
- **SLO requirements** for the request

#### 3. Model Switching Optimization

Aegaeon reduces switching overhead by **97%** through:

**Component Reuse:**

- Preserve compiled CUDA kernels across switches
- Reuse CUDA graphs between compatible models
- Share memory allocators and GPU contexts

**Fine-Grained GPU Memory Management:**

- Release only necessary memory during switches
- Maintain kernel compilation cache
- Preserve initialized CUDA contexts

**Optimized KV Cache Synchronization:**

- Efficient transfer of KV cache between models
- Minimal data copying during switches
- Selective cache preservation

### Performance Characteristics

- **Switching latency**: Sub-second (reduced from 30-100s)
- **Overhead reduction**: Up to 97% compared to traditional approaches
- **Concurrent models**: Multiple models on same GPU resources
- **SLO compliance**: Meets latency requirements through dynamic scheduling

### Use Cases

Aegaeon is particularly effective for:

- **Quality-latency trade-offs**: Switch to faster models when under
  latency pressure
- **Multi-tenant serving**: Serve different model sizes to different users
- **Cost optimization**: Use smaller models when quality requirements permit
- **Hybrid serving**: Combine large and small models for optimal cost/quality

## vLLM Sleep Mode: Fast Model Switching

[vLLM Sleep Mode](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/10/26/sleep-mode.html)
(released October 2025) enables ultra-fast model switching by preserving
process state while freeing GPU memory.

### The Challenge

Multi-model serving traditionally faces a painful dilemma:

- **Simultaneous loading**: GPU memory explosion 💸
- **Frequent switching**: 30-100 second wait times 🐌

### Sleep Mode Solution

vLLM Sleep Mode provides two operational levels:

#### Level 1: CPU Memory Offloading

**Characteristics:**

- Model weights moved to CPU RAM
- CUDA context and compiled kernels preserved
- Wake-up time: **0.1-0.8 seconds**
- Suitable for memory-abundant environments

**Memory Requirements:**

- GPU memory: Released (models unloaded)
- CPU memory: Full model weights retained
- Process state: Fully preserved

#### Level 2: Complete Weight Discarding

**Characteristics:**

- Model weights completely discarded
- Only process state preserved
- Memory footprint: **MB-level only**
- Ideal for cost-sensitive deployments

**Memory Requirements:**

- GPU memory: Released
- CPU memory: Minimal (process state only)
- Reload required: Full model reload from storage

### Why Sleep Mode is Fast

Traditional model switching requires:

❌ Restarting Python process  
❌ Re-initializing CUDA contexts  
❌ Re-compiling GPU kernels  
❌ Re-capturing CUDA graphs

Sleep Mode preserves process state:

✅ Memory allocators retained  
✅ CUDA graphs preserved  
✅ JIT-compiled kernels cached  
✅ Complete process state maintained

### Performance Benchmarks

#### A100 Large Model Tests

**Qwen3-235B (TP=4):**

- Cold start: 97.7 seconds 😫
- Sleep wake-up: 5.4 seconds ⚡
- **Speedup: 18x faster**

**Qwen3-Coder-30B:**

- Cold start: 47.4 seconds 😫
- Sleep wake-up: 2.9 seconds ⚡
- **Speedup: 17x faster**

#### A4000 Small Model Tests

**Qwen3-0.6B + Phi-3-vision:**

- Wake-up time: 0.1-0.8 seconds
- Equivalent to a finger snap 🫰
- **Speedup: 58-203x faster**

#### Multi-Switch Scenarios

**5 model switches comparison:**

- Traditional: 357 seconds
- Sleep mode: 125 seconds
- **Time saved: 65% (232 seconds)**

### First Inference Optimization

Sleep mode also accelerates initial inference:

- **First token latency**: 61-88% faster
- Benefit from preserved CUDA graphs
- No kernel recompilation overhead

### Configuration and Usage

```python
# vLLM sleep mode configuration
from vllm import EngineArgs

engine_args = EngineArgs(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B",
    sleep_mode="level1",  # or "level2"
    sleep_timeout=300,    # 5 minutes idle before sleep
    preserve_kv_cache=True
)
```

**Level Selection Guide:**

- **Level 1**: When you have sufficient CPU RAM and need fastest wake-up
- **Level 2**: When memory cost is critical and can tolerate slight delay

### Ideal Use Cases

✅ **Multi-model services** (customer service + translation + code assistant)  
✅ **Development/testing** (frequent model switching)  
✅ **Cost optimization** (small GPU instances)  
✅ **Cloud deployment** (pay-per-use billing)
